    <h1>Delete Account</h1>

    <p>At <strong>LovZa</strong>, we respect your right to control your data. If you wish to delete your account and all
        associated data, you generally have two options:</p>

    <h2>Option 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)</h2>
    <p>This is the fastest way to delete your account.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>LovZa</strong> app on your device.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> (gear icon usually found in the profile tab).</li>
        <li>Scroll down to the bottom and tap on <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen confirmation steps.</li>
        <li>Your account and data will be permanently deleted immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Option 2: Request Deletion via Email</h2>
    <p>If you cannot access the app or prefer to request deletion manually, you can contact our support team.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@lovza.com">support@lovza.com</a></li>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> Account Deletion Request</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> Please include your registered phone number or email address so we can locate your
            account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Please note that manual deletion requests may take up to 30 days to process.</em></p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Once your account is deleted, your profile will no longer be visible to other users. We may retain certain data
        for a limited period as required by law or for legitimate business validation purposes (e.g., fraud prevention),
        as outlined in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
